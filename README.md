# tartarus-web
A Javascript version of Tartarus so that humans can experience it as machines do... 

Let's keep track of a list of TODOs.

 * We have to record every move and combination - just as in the GPU version: if there will be many players, we may need a sql database to store information. After storing them, find out how much space they take, and plan ahead. 
 * We should also record the time between moves. 
 * We are giving extra information by displaying walls - the agent does not understand this (recheck our GPU paper). 
 * 100 human player should play around 10 to 20 games... 
 * The page requires information about how the game is played. Maybe a video would be much better.
